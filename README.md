## Dependancies

You will need to install axios in order for this app to function.

I used this open-source API for getting random words.
[Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Gameplay

Guess the word by typing in characters with your keyboard. Only alphabetical characters will be counted as guesses. You can guess incorrectly up to 6 times before you lose the game.

At the end of the game a modal will appear which gives you the option to start a new game.
